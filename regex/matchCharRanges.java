// In the context of a regular expression (RegEx), a character class is a set of characters
// enclosed within square brackets that allows you to match one character in the set.
//
// A hyphen (-) inside a character class specifies a range of characters where the left
// and right operands are the respective lower and upper bounds of the range. For example:
//
// [a-z] is the same as [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz].
// [A_Z] is the same as [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ].
// [0-9] is the same as [0123456789].
// In addition, if you use a caret (^) as the first character inside a character class,
// it will match anything that is not in that range. For example, [^0-9] matches any character 
// that is not a digit in the inclusive range from 0 to 9. It's important to note that, when
// used outside of (immediately preceding) a character or character class, the caret matches
// the first character in the string against that character or set of characters.
//
// Task
//
// Write a RegEx that will match a string satisfying the following conditions:
//
// The string's length is >=5.
// The first character must be a lowercase English alphabetic character.
// The second character must be a positive digit. Note that we consider zero to be neither positive nor negative.
// The third character must not be a lowercase English alphabetic character.
// The fourth character must not be an uppercase English alphabetic character.
// The fifth character must be an uppercase English alphabetic character.
