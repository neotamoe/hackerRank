# HackerRank

### https://www.hackerrank.com/

HackerRank is a site used to challenge and sharpen code skills.  Solutions are not only correct or incorrect, they also have an optimization component.  While sometimes brute force solutions will pass all their test cases, other times a test may time out which is the same as not passing.

Code is written in Java 7 or 8 with the exception of the folder titled Python.  

Unless otherwise specified, code included in this repo passed all test cases and is my own.  Please note that many of the exercises include a portion of code that is provided.  I tried to leave exercise comments and/or instructions indicating what is my code vs what was provided. 

e.g. 
`// Complete this function`
