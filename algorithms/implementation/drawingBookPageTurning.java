// Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their n-page book to page number p.
// Brie can either start turning pages from the front of the book (i.e., page number 1)
// or from the back of the book (i.e., page number n), and she always turns pages
// one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at once). When she opens
// the book, page 1 is always on the right side:
//
// Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for the last page which may only have a front side depending on the total number of pages of the book (see the Explanation sections below for additional diagrams).
//
// Given n and p, find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order
// to arrive at page p.
